1. User guide:
 
	The following command line is accepted:

   	bbserv [-d] [-f] [-p port] [-s port] [-T tmax] [-b bbfile]

   	where

     	 -b overrides (or sets) the file name bbfile according to its argument
     	 -T overrides Tmax according to its argument
     	 -p overrides the port number bp according to its argument
     	 -s overrides the port number sp according to its argument
     	 -f (with no argument) forces d to false or 0
     	 -d (with no argument) forces D to true or 1

   	The server functions with any telnet-capable client.The variable name and
   	value for each pair in this configuration file are separated by the = character
   	(with no blanks). It includes the following definitions, in no particular order:
      
      	THMAX=Tmax
      	BBPORT=bp
      	SYNCPORT=sp
      	BBFILE=bbfile
      	PEERS=peers
      	DAEMON=d
      	DEBUG=D

   	where D and d are Boolean values that can be expressed using either the integers 0 and 1 
	or the words false and true, Tmax, bp, and sp are strings that indicate positive numbers,
	bbfile is a file name, and bbfile is a Boolean value. The list of peers is made up of strings
	divided by blank spaces. Every one of these strings has the format host:port, where host is 
	the name of the host and port is a positive integer.
   
	For the replicated database system,
   	The server takes PEERS as replicated database, but it connects to replicated database once 
	a client connects to bulletin server.If peers are offline at that time, server will erase
	them in the list of replicated database.Therefore, synchronization only happens iff PEERS
	are online before the first client come in. If replicated peers didn't set ur server as 
	replicated server, the synchronization will be one way synchronization.
