1. Sending Protocol

    1.1 Ideas about the protocol
        
        Sender first sends n ACK packets to receiver.
        If they all of them return positve, message will be sent.
        If not, sender sends calloff to those positve receiver.

    1.2 States

        State idle:
            if (write)
                send "commit" x n peers
                if (positve_feedback < n)
                    return cancel
                return commit
            return idle

        State commit:
            send sync_message
            if (sucess)
                return
            else
                return cancel

        State cancel:
            send "calloff"
            return idle


2. Receiving Protocol

    2.1 Ideas about the protocol

        Receiver is waiting for the ACK message. 
        If there's some unknwon command, It won't response to them.
        If ACK is received, it check whether the server is writing.
        If I/O is processing, it sends negative besides of positve.
        After receiveing message, receiver waits for another ACK.

    2.2 States

        State idle:
            if (recv "commit")
                if (available)
                    return ready
                else
                    send negative_feedback
                    return idle
            return idle
        
        State ready:
            if (recv sync_message)
                save in bbfile
                return idle

            except:
                return idle
